About 15 years ago a group of us were gathered around a computer waiting for ["The Phantom Menace"][1] trailer to download.

It was still early enough in Internet time that an online debut was a problem. The combination of a big movie file and huge demand led to a giant trainwreck. It took hours to download even on our company's fast internet.

The trailer had 10 million downloads, which I seem to recall was the most [popular download][5] of its time, though it's likely been surpassed since.

Within seconds of ["The Force Awakens"][2] trailer popping up, thousands, if not millions had seen it and were already [tweeting][6] about it.

How times changed. One thing to remember is that in 1998, "The Phantom Menace" trailer looked awesome. [Go watch it.][1] It's got some Jar Jar, sure, but face it, but there's nothing to suggest it would be terrible. Good trailers mean nothing, case in point [one][3], and case in point [two][4].

My response to the Millennium Falcon and the "Star Wars" theme is almost [pavlovian][7], so it's hard to make a rational assessment of any "Star Wars" trailer.

Rather, the implicit message of "The Force Awakens" trailer seems to be a sort of relationship counseling. "We know you've been hurt in the past. It's OK to love again."

MG Siegler seems to have hit the nail on the head with this [tweet][15]:

>Pretty sure that teaser is already better than any of the last three Star Wars films.

The trailer has left me giddy, sure. But ...

I posit "The Star Wars Problem". Most people fell in love with "Star Wars" as children. We love it completely and irrationally, so irrationally that *no movie* including "Star Wars" itself could ever meet expectations.

What I want is that [moment][16] in a theater when the lights go down, a "long time ago..." appears to silence followed by a blare of of horns, the "Star Wars" logo and the iconic theme music and crawl. *"It is a period of civil war ..."*

It's a moment of pure transcendent transporting joy back into the comfort of childhood that no movie can possibly equal it.

Whatever comes after that moment just needs to be "[not terrible][17]."  Guess we'll know for sure in about a year.
