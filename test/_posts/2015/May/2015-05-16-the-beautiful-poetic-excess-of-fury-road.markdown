There's something end-times Roman Empire about *Mad Max: Fury Road.*

It's not a new idea that the decadence of the Romans' entertainments said as much about the people who enjoyed them as it did about the entertainments themselves. *Fury Road* is the kind of over-the-top orgy of blood and violence and inhumanity and mayhem that an ancient Roman can only dream about.

Times may change, but people don't.

Read as commentary, *Fury Road* is all our excesses -- love of violence, celebrity culture, braggadocio, flaunting vulgarity -- drawn out to a logical conclusion. The dystopian world of *Mad Max* combines the brutality of ISIS throwing gays off a building as a crowd cheers with the "hey, look-at-me" vulgarity of the Kardashians.

The villain's skull face mask and motorcycle-sprocket codpiece are as much his personal brand as his costume. It's not a stretch to think of Donald Trump, freed of his last constraints of good taste, dubbing himself Rictus Erectus and riding around in a Mercedes E-class mounted on a monster truck chassis.

I suspect the production designers and people who came up with the cars had an absolute blast making this movie. One can imagine the production meetings:

*"What if the attack force were led by a giant truck with rows of taiko drummers and a mutated guy playing power chords in front of a towering stack of amps?"*

*"I doubt audiences would like that. So, we also need to also make the guitar a flame thrower to be sure."*

*High fives.*

Humanity seems to be constantly at war between its good and evil natures. If history -- or current events, actually -- is any indication, evil nature wins as often as good.

One of the movie's memorable moments comes when Nux, a young, naive War Boy --  his head filled with dreams of glory, barreling across the desert, surrounded by carnage -- plunges into an apocalyptic sandstorm shouting "Oh, what a day. What a lovely day!"

Exiting the theater, I overheard someone comment that Nux symbolized a Taliban fighter. Possibly, but I think he's us at our very worst, heedlessly storming ahead into the unknown and danger, reveling in the spectacle of it all and not caring what it means.

It's not a stretch to say a culture that lines up for iPhones or Air Jordans would, if driven to the brink, kill for food.

"Mad Max" walks a fine line. It shows our worst cultural excesses while reveling in them in beautiful, poetic, glorious fashion. All while wearing a shit-eating grin.

And I loved it. What a movie.
