Winter creates a magic moment every time it snows. The world falls silent. The landscape is transformed by a blanket of white. The mundane and grimy is suddenly covered in sparkles and beauty.

Spring and summer rarely see that type of sudden transformation. You can feel it perhaps in the golden hour or just after a summer shower. But you don't get the feeling of entering a different, magical world.

Except for one special day.

Boston had a terrible long, -- [seemingly endless][1] -- winter. Even last week jackets and coats were the norm. The mercury said it should be warm, but a stiff, chilly wind made sure temps were cold enough to be not *actually* warm.

Yesterday the weather turned, and with it gray of winter has suddenly been swept away. For several days I could tell that everything was just about to bloom. Trees were budding and bits of green could be seen, building-up energy and about to burst forth.

Today was that magical day when the line was crossed and stark, barren winter is finally gone. Leaves on the trees, flowers blooming everywhere -- it has that same world-transformed feel of a winter snowfall, but awash in color and life.

Today was that special day. That first true spring day. It's my favorite day of the year.
