S _tar Wars_ vs. _Star Trek_. Which is best?

This is an eternal burning question that cannot be answered, seemingly. Do we even need to? For many a geek, both franchises embody a deep love.

It's as ubiquitous as East Coast vs. West Coast or Ginger vs. Mary Ann. The debate has even spawned such subdebates as The Enterprise vs. an Imperial Star Destroyer. <sup>[1][1]</sup>

Like that [episode][5] of _Cheers_ that argued there's enough room in this world for fans of _The Munsters_ and _The Addams Family_, we can always cop out and refuse to make a choice.

One could argue that both are unique in their own way and that fans should just love them both equally. Although anyone with a brother or sister knows "I love you both equally" is a well-intentioned [lie][6].

The problem is exacerbated still further by the fact that _both franchises_ are under the control of the same man: JJ Abrams. Allowing two longtime competing sci-fi franchises to become separate visions of a single creator <sup>[2][2]</sup> makes judging their respective qualities all the harder. We're really just judging him.

And to be fair, he has led _Star Trek_ into a renaissance -- of sorts. It's hard to argue that the 2009 movie isn't a decided improvement over previous Trek movies. <sup>[3][3]</sup>

It's exciting, fast-paced and, more importantly, fun. The film has a sleek and modern production design -- the Enterprise bridge looks like an [Apple Store][7]. But those alone don't make for a good _Star Trek_ movie.

Abrams is an avowed _Star Wars_ fan. In the runup to the _Star Trek_ relaunch he managed to repeatedly enrage fans by stating he [didn't like][8] _Star Trek_ and didn't watch it. So, no surprise that he departed _Trek_ to direct _Wars_. In his mind it's a step up. But it seems almost redundant because he also he turned _Star Trek_ into _Star Wars_.

The plot parallels between _Star Trek_ and _A New Hope_ are uncanny, beyond the [hero's journey][9] employed as a character arc in any movie with epic aspirations. It wasn't just the orphaned farm boy going to space or the planet-killing bad guy or making a stop on a very Hoth-like planet. Abram's reboot was much more in the fast-paced, episodic action-adventure vein of _Star Wars_.

It loses some essential Trekiness. The best scene in of all the movies -- of any _Trek_ for that matter -- is the [initial showdown][15] between Capt, Kirk and the eponymous villain in _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan._ Sure, it involves some _pew pew pew_ lasers, but what makes it great is that it's all about Capt. Kirk outthinking his enemy.

By comparison both _Star Trek_ reboot movies feel like the film equivalent of a cover version of a song. They only exist because of the original.

Considering this, the upcoming _The Force Awakens_ is much less of a mystery. If we had to guess what it is going to be like, we'd go with "a lot like the 2009 _Star Trek_ reboot." That's actually the movie he's been longing to make, it'll just be _Star Wars_ this time.

But even as the two franchises drift toward one another, the eternal question of which is better, _Trek_ or _Wars_, is in a way quantifiable.  

If one were to take all the various incarnations of _Trek_ -- the movies, the five TV series, the animated series -- and rank them against the whole of _Star Wars_ -- the six movies, the two Ewok TV movies, the animated movie and TV show, the holiday special -- which percentage-wise would have the most bad.

For beloved franchises, both have a wealth of embarrassingly bad moments. At the outset we'll concede that by sheer volume of bad, _Trek_ wins easily because there's so much more of it. But by percentage -- that gets dicey.

One might quickly jump to _The Star Wars Holiday Special,_ which is canon because it introduces Chewbacca's home planet of [Kashyyyk][11] and Boba Fett. Surely nothing in Trekdom is as bad as a [cooing][10] Diane Carroll providing virtual reality spank material for Chewbacca's grandfather Itchy.

But then we have Spock [jamming][12] on his Vulcan harp with space hippies in _TOS_ episode _Journey to Eden_. For every "I don't like sand" line from _Star Wars_ there's a "Brain? Brain? What is brain?"

The _Star Wars_ prequels get lots of [fan hate][13] -- justifiably so. Entire swaths of the Star Trek canon may not sink quite as low, but they certainly suffered from creative exhaustion. Later seasons of _Voyager_ and most of _Enterprise_ are a grim slog indeed.

In any mathematical quantifying of the franchises, _Star Trek_ would probably lose to _Star Wars_ on the overall quality front. But it would be close. In either case, there's certainly more bad than good in both franchises.

But quality issues aside, the needs of Hollywood blockbusters mean that we aren't going to get the same types of movies or TV shows that made us fans in the first place. In this regard _Star Wars_ faces a greater degree of difficulty.

_Star Wars_ is something people fall in love with in their childhood. As a result, we love it irrationally.

A colleague one said he didn't see _A New Hope_ until he was in his 40s. When asked what he thought of it, he paused and said "Well, the dialogue is really bad." He's not wrong, but fans are willing to overlook this and revel in childhood joy. _Star Trek_, by being present culturally through multiple incarnations, at least had a chance to grow up along side its fans.

_The Force Awakens_ is freighted with expectations, expectations it can't meet. The deep love of childhood nostalgia attached to _Star Wars_ means that no movie -- not even _Star Wars_ itself -- is good enough to be the idealized movie we carry around in our heads.

An attempt to create that idealized movie is about to be repeated over and over - a _Star Wars_ [cinematic universe][14]. Whether  _Star Wars_ can become an open-ended series and retain its special place in our culture remains to be seen.

Regardless of all the "what does it mean," _Star Wars_ fans are sure to break box office records and flock to the movie. It doesn't actually matter if it's good or not. But let's hope it is.

Whether one franchise is better than the other is probably at this point is irrelevant because the only perfect realization of either series exists in our own head. Any filmmaker can only guess and try to get it right.


1. <span id="footnote-one-sw-st"></span>Imperial Star Destroyer, easily. Everybody knows this.
2. <span id="footnote-two-sw-st"></span>Ronald D. Moore's stewardship of _Star Trek_ and _Battlestar Galactica_ shows this can work, even if _BSG_ felt like Moore finally getting to do what he wanted with _Deep Space Nine_ and _Voyager's_ overall themes.

4. <span id="footnote-four-sw-st"></span> Bea Arthur and Harvey Korman are both part of _Star Wars_ canon. Deal with that, fans.
