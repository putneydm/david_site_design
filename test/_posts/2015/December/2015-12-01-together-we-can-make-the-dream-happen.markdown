promo: "Please help fund our holiday fundraising drive"
quote: It's been a tough year financially for Davidputney.com.

This is the time of year when the inequalities of life seem the most profound.

Many of us revel in abundance while others do without. As Bono once so sagely sang "Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you." Now don't you feel guilty?

That is why we are excited to announce our 2015 holiday fund drive to help to bring joy to a troubled world. Davidputney.com and you -- _actually, we prefer to think of it as us_ -- working together, hand-in-hand can help create a bright spot that can touch the lives of dozens of people every month.

We need your help to fund the purchase of the davidputney.sucks [top-level domain][4].

Owning davidputney.sucks has been a longtime dream of ours,<sup>[1][1]</sup> and no doubt it is a sentiment shared by anyone who has ever read this site.

No amount that you can give is too small. If only 329.81 people were to give $1 we could hit our goal of $329.81. However, we would actually encourage each of those 329.81 people to give at least $10 so that we could have even more money. If you could swipe a credit card from a loved one and give double that, it would be even better.

Why do a fundraising drive for davidputney.sucks?

We know that $329 doesn't sound like much money to to a far-reaching internet enterprise such as this one.  But, it's been a tough year financially for Davidputney.com.

Our revenue is up, sure, but our bottom line has taken a serious hit once we figure in executive bonuses, executive pay increases, executive housing stipends, executive travel reimbursements, executive stock options, executive bonuses and the cost of the Pinkerton guards to oversee our layoffs.  

Also, we'd just prefer to have someone else pay.

Think of it as something like a Kickstarter project except at the end we keep all the money and you don't actually get anything. In other words, it's just like most Kickstarter projects.

So, please, give till it hurts. Give till your eyes bleed. Give.
