The Boston Globe is lauded -- rightfully -- for being the first major responsive website.

It won Society of News Design honors. The technological step forward was what made me want to work there as a designer.

That's why this tweet jumped out at me.

<div style="margin:auto;max-width:498px;margin-bottom:20px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Somewhere, under all of these dialog boxes, there is allegedly a <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe">@BostonGlobe</a> article. <a href="http://t.co/xa2HvLKJh0">pic.twitter.com/xa2HvLKJh0</a></p>&mdash; Waldo Jaquith (@waldojaquith) <a href="https://twitter.com/waldojaquith/status/560423510905217024">January 28, 2015</a></blockquote>

</div>

He's right. This page is a total hot mess, and it makes me sad. Is this one of the world's best designed sites any more?


**Disclaimer** *I am [former Globe employee][2] and I have many good friends who still work there in the design and development departments. They are talented, hardworking folks who are not responsible for institutional decisions.*
