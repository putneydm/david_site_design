It's how you expected phones to be 10 or 15 years from now, not right now.

I've always viewed that statement as one of the more insightful analyses of the original iPhone. Consider it a mission statement for the iPhone in general.

The iPhone is quite literally the most important phone in the world in this regard. Yes, Android is important, but it's inventing the future in a different way. <sup>[1][1]</sup>

Within a few weeks something close to half of iPhone users will be on [iOS 10][5] and several million will be walking around with phones without a headphone jack, something Android would take years to achieve.<sup>[2][2]</sup>

When Apple does something it ceases to be theoretical and becomes the way things are. Perhaps that's why people lost their shit over the headphone jack, this [Verge story][4] "Taking the headphone jack off <sup>[3][3]</sup> phones is user-hostile and stupid" being a primary example.

They also lost their shit when Apple killed [PCI slots][6]. Or [floppy drives][7]. Or hardware [keyboards][8] on phones. Or serial and SCSI [ports][9]. Or [ethernet][16]. Or [Flash][17] <sup>[4][18]</sup>. Or whatever. So much shit losing through the years.

The cycle works something like this:

* **Step One)** Hah hah hah! Apple is so stupid and arrogant!
* **Step Two)** Everybody copies Apple as quickly as possible.

Apple's moves now are clearly about the future, what an iPhone sold 10 or 15 years from now might look like. No doubt they've already made [concept designs][10].

It'll likely be the Platonic ideal of a a pocket computer, Super thin, light, minimalist, perhaps only a thin slab of glass, like the cell [phones][11] depicted in the movie _Looper_. It might not even have a screen. It may be something you wear on your wrist. Or interface with via voice commands. Or some [other][12] way.

That amazing, super thin, future phone is not likely to have a headphone cord with a circa 19th century [3.5mm analog][14] jack dangling from it. It will be a wireless, purely digital device. An amazing, sleek future phone would likely have no ports or buttons at all.

Feel free to roll your eyes at Apple citing "[courage][13]" as their reason. I know I am. Or have reservations about Apple replacing a ubiquitous, open-standard port with a [proprietary][15] one. I certainly do.

But ditching that port is all about getting from here to there. It had to happen sometime. Someone had to do it. Apple did.



1. <span id="footnote-one-headphone"></span>Android is a close follower. Its hardware market is too fragmented and uptake of new versions too slow to really drive the industry. Android is important because it runs on cheap hardware and makes computing available to everyone.
2. <span id="footnote-two-headphone"></span>15 percent of users are on Android Marshmallow, introduced almost a year ago.
3. <span id="footnote-three-headphone"></span>Heh Heh. "Jack off."
4. <span id="footnote-four-headphone"></span>Anybody remember Android phones being advertised as "[Flash ready][19]?" Don't worry, [Godot][20] will get here any minute now!
