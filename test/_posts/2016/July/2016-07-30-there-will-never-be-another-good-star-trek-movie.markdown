The sequence showing the Enterprise being destroyed in _Star Trek Beyond_ is a technical marvel.

The techniques that created the vast swarm of ships that suddenly attack, overwhelm and pulverize the iconic vessel is light years beyond the original series. It's far beyond the model work used to destroy the Enterprise in _Star Trek III_.

But when the Enterprise goes down in a [heroic sacrifice][15] in _ST:III_, it feels tragic, a lost friend. "My god, Bones, what have I done?" Kirk intones as the crew watches horrified as the ship burns up in the atmosphere.

_Star Trek Beyond_ isn't invested in its destruction sequence as anything more than making sure it looks as cool as possible. Considering this is the third Enterprise to bite the dust in a movie, it's not even a surprise plot development any more. <sup>[1][16]</sup>

_Star Trek Beyond_ just isn't very good.

By a certain measure it's perfectly fine. It's terrifically cast,  with fast-paced action, sleek sets, state-of-the-art special effects and a fantastic score by [Michael Giacchino][3].

Problem is, _Star Trek Beyond_ relies on all of these to get by. It's woefully underwritten, with a stock villain -- [Idris Elba][4], unrecognizable and underused as, what's his name? _Krag? Kris? Krall? Krusty?_ Who can even remember or be bothered to care? Character arcs, at least for those fortunate enough to get one -- Sorry, Sulu -- are a more like arrow-straight lines. <sup>[2][2]</sup>

This is something of a surprise considering how well Simon Pegg, doing double duty here as actor and cowriter, dug into his characters' inner lives in his [Cornetto trilogy][6].

But that's blockbuster movies these days. Longtime _Trek_ fans whinge about the state of the franchise, but it comes off as a little ungrateful and, frankly, fusty, as so aptly [parodied][6] by The Onion.

Before the [2009 reboot][7], the film franchise had been residing happily in the mid-budget tier, a model set by the modestly-budgeted-but-successful _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_. <sup>[3][3]</sup> Now, _Star Trek_ needs $200 million to get made and a half billion in box office to break even. It's big money.

_Star Trek Beyond_ and its two predecessors feel more like giant scale blockbusters because they are. They reduce characters to types -- _Kirk's a horndog! Checkov's Russian!_ -- get the quippy comedy and relationship squabbles right -- _that Dr. McCoy and Spock sure do bicker a lot!_ -- and even throw in a little world building. They're the shallowest bits people like about _Star Trek_.

_Trek_ originated on TV -- "radio with pictures" -- and it was a show largely about ideas. Episodes such as _[The Devil in the Dark][8]_ countered 50's sci-fi monster tropes (The real monster is us!). Or [_The City in the Edge of Forever_][9] that dealt with time travel paradoxes in a particularly tragic, cerebral way.

_Star Trek: The Next Generation_ went even deeper into this notion of a show about ideas. _Deep Space Nine_ took it in a far darker, bleaker direction.

Yes, by today's standards parts of it are a bit hokey. And the show and films were even completely silly at times. Or in the case of _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_, slower than the glaciation of North America while also being completely silly.  

Or sometimes completely hopeless, like _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_.

Hollywood might not make movies of the type the _Star Trek_ film series used to be, but they do make television of the type _Star Trek_ was -- thoughtful, well-written, groundbreaking, experimental.

That's why the [_Star Trek Discovery_][10] series trailer that premiered alongside _Star Trek Beyond_ at [Comic-Con][11] gives such hope. _Star Trek_'s natural home is series television.

The show has two _Trek_ [veterans][12] at the helm, a fidelity to deep _Trek_ [history][13] and an environment that rewards strong, clear visions. A more human scale, deeper _Star Trek_ seems the likely result.

Then again, it's CBS who mainly churns out low-grade trash -- [_Big Bang Theory_][14], anyone? -- so maybe not.

1. <span id="footnote-star-trek-beyond-three"></span>The saucer crash sequence in _Star Trek Beyond_ is basically the saucer crash sequence from _Star Trek: Generations_ done with a bigger budget and better tools.
2. <span id="footnote-star-trek-beyond-one"></span>And, note to _Star Trek_ stop using The Beastie Boys' _Sabotage_. It's a 20-plus year-old song that only old people like me think is cool.
3. <span id="footnote-star-trek-beyond-two"></span> _Wrath of Khan_ was produced by Paramount's television division. It reused footage from _Star Trek: TMP_, reused sets and rented equipment and employed other cost-cutting trickery to keep costs down ofter the big-budget failure of the previous movie.
