The reaction to John Oliver's 19-minute rant about the decline of newspapers immediately struck a chord among journalists.

Within minutes of the segment's airing, journalists were jizzing themselves on Twitter over its "truth to power", "somebody finally said it" qualities. The Washington Post [declared][8] it the "best defense of newspapers ever."

The fact that journalists excitedly [agreed][8] with Oliver's report doesn't make it correct. To me, that's a giant [confirmation bias][17] red flag. As Upton Sinclair wrote "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it."

Fact is, nothing is particularly bad about the Oliver segment, nor is it the best anything ever, either. It mainly serves to flatter journalists. Who doesn't want to hear their work is important and people should buy it?

It just misses the point widely. It's clear he doesn't understand the problem -- _the real problem_ --  that besets the industry.

Here's the complaint: People used to pay for news, and then the Internet came along and everyone gets it for free now. Or they blame mismanagement and [layoffs][9] for the long slide. Or [stupid][10] reinvention efforts.

Yes, the Internet did cause people to drop print subscriptions. Yes, stupid shit did go down. The publisher of the paper <sup>[1][1]</sup> I worked for took home $1 million, largely due to [performance bonuses][11] gained from laying off my friends. And yes, Tronc is a buzzword-driven bullshit factory.

I'll stipulate to all of that.

While it is true the internet _did_ destroy the business of newspapers, but not because "nobody pays for news any more." It was in deeper, more irreversible ways.

From World War II to about the early 2000s, newspapers were a business with near-monopolies in local news and advertising, with eye-watering ad rates to match. One paper I worked at was so lavishly funded that it once had an in-house dry cleaner and hair salon.

Control of news and advertising came about because of a monopoly on something far more important and difficult: Local mass distribution.

Reporters and editors probably don't like to believe that the core competency that sets their business apart is light manufacturing and product distribution. Newspapers' appeal to advertisers, whether that be a regular person running a garage sale ad to a multi-million dollar retailer such as Macy's, was  the distribution network.

The logistics of doing this, owning a printing plant, buying paper and ink in bulk, employing a fleet of trucks and drivers, organizing routes <sup>[2][2]</sup>, were an insurmountable barrier to entry for anyone wanting to capture even a portion of a local newspaper's advertising business. <sup>[3][3]</sup> This gave newspapers double-digit margins and the economic freedom to create giant newsrooms.

As long as the ads paid the bills and made the owners rich, newsrooms could do whatever they wanted. We got things like the reporting portrayed in movies like _All the President's Men_ or more recently the Oscar-winning _Spotlight_. This freedom also bred suspicion, if not downright hostility in newsrooms to the business interests of the paper.

But news is a business. Cheap distribution offered by the internet utterly destroyed the monopoly on distribution. When that fell, the monopolies on local news and advertising that newspapers enjoyed fell along with it.  

These monopolies can never be re-created, the conditions they spawned never recaptured. Newspapers can try with [paywalls][12] and their promise to reach exclusive customers, but revenue from paywalls is about 1 percent of newspaper revenue.

While the Internet was destroying the foundations of the news business model, it also challenged the fundamental idea of the news product itself.

Newspapers grew up in a time of news scarcity. As a result, they are general interest, with a little something for everyone, from international news down to a story about the new PTA president. There was Ann Landers and a bridge column for the blue-hairs, comics for the kids, recipes for mom <sup>[4][4]</sup>.

If newspapers were a retailer they'd be a Super Walmart. We stock everything! But here's a thing that most people don't know about retail (or newspapers): They don't sell "products", or in the case of newspapers, "news." They sell availability.

Consumers can get their coffee at a store instead of driving to the Folgers plant or their diapers without having to deal with Pampers directly. Likewise, newspapers made scarce things  -- news, crosswords, Ann Landers, Garfield -- available to a local audience.

It's now a largely [post-scarcity][13] world when it comes to news. Any story about anything ever is available right now on the magic pocket computers that everyone carries everywhere and fiddles with constantly.

Newspapers still have limited availability to sell -- local news and sports, mainly -- but everything else is available elsewhere. The newspaper as currently defined -- a general interest publication and a sprawling organization to produce it -- has no actual reason to exist any more.

So, how do newspapers survive?

They don't. Or, more properly, they can't.

That's hard for some folks to hear. Some people will argue nostalgia and tradition and importance like John Oliver did. But trying to preserve a business in its present form for reasons of "this is how it's always been done" is not a solution.

I was reminded of this when reading, of all things, an article about the retail business. Ben Thompson of [Stratechery][16] dug up a 1991 quote from Sears spokesman after Walmart displaced it as world's largest retailer.

> “We feel the mission of Sears is to be an integrated, powerful specialty merchant, with brand names and our own lines of exclusive merchandise. We feel that distinguishes us from other retail specialty stores or discount chains.”

This is the same kind of "people trust us and count on us we have the best news" happy talk newspapers see as their core brand virtue. Thompson's thesis is that Sears chose the wrong path decades before, which made its current collapse [inevitable][14].

Newspapers also chose a path decades ago that has led to this inevitable end. It's right there to be seen.

5. <span id="footnote-five-news-biz"></span>Analyst Benedict Evans observed that Amazon is Google for shopping. In a traditional store, a shopper goes to a physical space to choose from whatever stock the store might have. The promise of Amazon is that it has *absolutely everything* and that the shopper will be able to quickly find exactly the right thing they want to buy. Google is Google for newspapers. It reduces them from a monolithic organization to a single item, eliminating the need for a central news repository and its limited stock.
