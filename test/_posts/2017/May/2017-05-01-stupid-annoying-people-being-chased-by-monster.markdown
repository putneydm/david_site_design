A*lien* may be one of the most influential movies ever made, but the actual plot of the movie could not be more simple.

It's the stuff of many a B-grade monster movie. The crew of a space tug [_Nostromo_][20] brings an alien creature on board their ship that proceeds to kill them all. That simplicity is a strength.

_Alien_ is so good because of _how_ the story is told. It's why it's such an enduring and timeless <sup>[1][1]</sup> masterpiece. The claustrophobic setting, the tension and the groundbreaking production design alone are enough to define it as a classic.

But the creature itself in design and concept is the real reason the movie endures. It's disturbing somewhere down in our lizard brain. From its face raping initial appearance to its eyeless-skullfaced remorseless killer adult form, it's a nightmare being. In a world of Predators and Terminators and Freddys and Jasons, the Alien xenomorph reigns supreme.

In 1979, _Alien_ was tense and disturbing in a way that few audiences had seen up until then -- with the exceptions of maybe _Jaws_ or _Halloween_. But _Alien_ upped the ante by locking its characters in with the murder creature that has a head shaped like a penis just to fuck with the audience's psychosexual phobias.

The franchise was revisited in 1986 by a then-up-and-coming James Cameron in _Aliens_. He kept the claustrophobia but in true sequel fashion ramped up the more! more! more! Unlike the "haunted house in space" of the first film he went with balls-out war movie -- _Zulu_ in space. _Aliens_ is one of the greatest <sup>[2][2]</sup> action movies ever made and certainly one of the most relentlessly intense.

Sigourney Weaver's imposing screen presence is used to great effect, as her Ellen Ripley is not only the best female action hero in screen history, she's one of the best ever of any actor. And who could forget the late Bill Paxton as "game over, man" Pvt. Hudson.

_Aliens_ is among the rarest of things: A sequel better <sup>[3][3]</sup> than the original.

Some film franchises took awhile to gain speed -- James Bond, _Star Trek_ -- but _Alien_ kicked off with two all-time classic movies, seminal films that became a foundation of one of film's enduring movie series. Perhaps only _Star Wars_ had this same one-two punch of masterpieces.

How do you follow that? They did't.

There has not been a good _Alien_ movie in theaters since 1986. Yet they continue to make them. Worse, the franchise has become just another entry in the "stupid, annoying people being chased by a monster" genre.

It isn't like they haven't tried to make a good movie. The history of the _Alien_ universe is littered with missed opportunities. On paper they sound like the most amazing marriages of subject matter and talent since George Lucas considered Steven Spielberg to [direct][13] _Return of the Jedi_.

Consider these pitches <sup>[4][4]</sup>

* An _Alien_ movie directed by [David Fincher][14], who you may remember from such films as _Seven_, _Fight Club_ and _Gone Girl_. OMG! It'll be great!
* An _Alien_ movie written by Joss Whedon, a master of melding lightweight pop culture ideas with deep-seated human emotions, horror and action, eg, _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ and _Cabin in the Woods_. Holy shit! I can't wait!
* An _Alien_ movie with franchise originator Ridley Scott returning to the director's chair and written by _Lost_ mastermind Damon Lindelof. Mind. Blown.

The results are:

* _Alien 3_, a long, boring mess that still somehow gave us the most [iconic image][6] of the entire franchise.
* _Alien Resurrection_ a long, boring mess that still somehow gave us this [amazing shot][10] of Sigourney Weaver making an over- her-shoulder three-pointer on the first take.
*  _Prometheus_ a long boring mess that nonetheless gave us the [awesome phrase][9] "the _Prometheus_ school of running away from things."

Unfortunately the foundational idea of _Alien_ isn't that complex -- that simple plot of the first film. There's no real Extended Universe of story options. Marvel keeps it fresh by making genre movies with superheroes in them. _Iron Man 3_'s buddy cop movie. _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_'s '70s paranoid thriller. _Guardians of the Galaxy_'s sci-fi romp.

Every _Alien_ movie is roughly this: Humans stupidly bring the xenomorph on board â€“ _hey look, it's a big scary egg chamber! Let's have a closer look!_ The xenomorph gets loose because the humans underestimate its danger and then it goes around feasting on the humans' delicious nougaty centers for most of Act Three.

_Prometheus_ was this except with black slime.

They also continue the tradition of various [body horrors][15], to diminishing returns. _Alien: Resurrection_ gives us a room full of malformed Ripley / xenomorph [clones][16] going "k-k-k-kill me. Every moment I'm alive is agony." The baby squid monster<sup>[5][5]</sup> extraction of _Prometheus_ is cringey and memorable. But these read like setpieces.

Face it, the xenomorph isn't that scary any more. The body horrors of the _Alien_ spawning cycle are so well known that you can buy a [hand knit facehugger][7] to keep your head warm in the winter. Or a xenomorph [plushie][12]. Here in Boston there's even an _Alien: Convenant_ [train car][21] with xenomorph pics everywhere.

Thanks to cultural osmosis and [copying][8], the alien larvae bursting out of John Hurt's chest looking like the universe's most toothy and terrifying [stiffy][17] has a blunted impact at best.

Based on clips of _Alien: Covenant_ we're in for a whole new cavalcade of dismemberments a blood squib explosions.

Like the _Jurassic Park_ [movies][18], the _Alien_ series can have whatever first-act setup seems fitting -- a mix of human stupidity, failure to recognize danger, greed and a dollop of corporate malfeasance so the audience can learn that we were the real monsters all along. But at the end of the day the creatures have to escape and chase everyone around because that's what the movies actually are.

_Prometheus_ went for "what's it all mean" grandiosity and wedded _At the Mountains of Madness_ [mythology][19] to the franchise. But it ended up being just a bunch of half-explained Damon Lindeleof mystery box hooey with a group of stupid and annoying humans being chased around for the entire third act. Personally, I was rooting for the aliens.

We'll probably continue to get _Alien_ movies. We as an audience set expectations of recapturing the visceral fear of _Alien_ or the intense, unrelenting action of the _Aliens_. Movie studios like nice reliable franchises.

But capturing the greatness of the originals it's not possible any more than recapturing a first kiss.


1. <span id="footnote-one"></span>I saw it recently in a one-night theater screening and I have no doubt that it could debut today virtually unchanged -- perhaps a few special effects tweaks -- and still be seen as a masterpiece. Or not. It's been so copied down the years that critics would condemn it as derivative.
2. <span id="footnote-two"></span>The others are _Die Hard_ and _Mad Max: Fury Road_.
3. <span id="footnote-three"></span>The others are _The Empire Strikes Back_, _Toy Story 2_, _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, _From Russia With Love_, _The Dark Knight_, _Spider-Man 2_, _Mad Max: Fury Road_ and _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_. There are no others. And yes, I'm aware of _The Godfather II_ and _Terminator 2: Judgement Day_.
4. <span id="footnote-four"></span>_Alien vs. Predator_ and its execrable sequel are not on this list as they are not canon. I once watched _Alien vs. Predator_ at 6 a.m. while heavily hung over in a Times Square hotel room. Don't ask why. The movie was dreadful.
5. <span id="footnote-five"></span>While this is certainly the most effective scene in the movie, it's hampered by the fact that the baby squid monster is kinda [cute][11]. Just a little.
