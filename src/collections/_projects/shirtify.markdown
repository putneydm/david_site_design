A friend of mine had the same shirt and we always seemed to wear it on the same day. Shirtify is a joke, but it’s a joke that actually worked. The back end is a Google spreadsheet of dates on which I wore my shirt. It calculates the average intervals between wearings and predicts when the next likely time that I will wear the shirt. The threat level warnings — based on Homeland Security terror threat levels — is real-time info. The details chart is made in Flot and updates when the spreadsheet changes.
