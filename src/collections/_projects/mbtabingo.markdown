MBTABingo is a game that people can play completely on Twitter, although it has a website component to show rank and results. To get a card, simply tweet to @mbtabingo. A bingo card will be returned attached to a tweet. To fill out the card, tweet photos with the correct hashtag to @mbtabingo.

The bot will return a card with the square filled out.

This projects was created by [@mclaughlin][1] and [@abtran][1] and me for an MIT hackathon. My role was create a responsive Bingo card in HTML/CSS.

Twitter awarded us “Best Use of API” award at the hackathon and wrote up our entry on the [Twitter developer blog][3].
