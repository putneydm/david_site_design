project: Bose had an ambitious goal of creating and selling the first over-the counter hearing aid. It needed to be discreet, comfortable and stylish. It also needed to be dead-easy to use. I designed on-device controls -- boiling complex ideas down to a single button action -- so a user could quickly and easily access life-changing features.

* Allow people to connect with others in social situations that are made difficult or impossible by hearing loss
* Guide a user through the setup process to eliminate the need for professional assistance 
* Launch a new FDA-regulated product category

A hearing aid wasn't just an engineering problem to be solved. This would be a truly personal item for users, something they would depend on, trust. Users often raved about the device. "I can hear leaves rustling when I go for a walk" or "I can go out to restaurants with friends again." This personal connection would imbue it with true emotional meaning.
