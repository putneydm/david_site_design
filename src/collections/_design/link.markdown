### Creating a fresh brand in an industry that was itself a damaged brand.

In the news business, *your content is your brand.* So Link needed to emphatically not be what had come before.

The core Link group did a brand exercise, and landed on several keywords. Among them: "genuine," "lively" and "active." Being cool wasn't our aim. We didn't want to be [Poochie the Dog][1]. *Editorial voice* was far more key to success than design alone. We focused on *how* it spoke as well as what it spoke about. Link was:

* Conversational -- Written in normal language and not "newspaper speak."
* Excited -- Tell stories we are excited to share them with readers. If we can't be excited about them, how can readers?
* Explain, don't tell -- Stories were informed by the key parameters of what happened, what it means and what's next.
* Active stories -- Readers should be able to go do  -- concerts, crafts, get-togethers, etc.
* Solve problems for readers -- Life-hack type stories would take precedence, such has health, home, cooking and lifestyle.
