Link began with the idea of a newspaper for younger readers. My job was to give that idea form and voice.

It began in the fall of 2006 with a secret brainstorming session at my apartment. I became design director, and my job was to build the design prototypes. I chose the typography, colors, created the flow through the product and shaped its overall presentation of the news.

From the outset, I meant for Link to be the opposite of newspapers. Short, punchy and colorful, it spoke with a clear, loud voice — like a friend excited to tell you about something cool. It was meant to be a product that people had genuine affection for.

I took a cue from magazines and filled the front part of Link with fun, short lively items. The popular Kitty Sez dished out daily snark. The Daily Fortune added a dose of affirmation. Something to Talk About Today gave everyone a conversation starter.

Link articles were short and snappy. Designs were lively, with an emphasis on visuals, graphics and tight editing. This was produced by a design and editing dream-team whose work won several Society of News Design Awards of Excellence. Most notably, Link was a finalist for World's Best Designed Newspaper in 2006, after only three months of issues.

Our readers an advertisers loved us, but our parent company didn’t share that feeling. Link was victim of the 2008 recession and the decline of newspapers. Revenue was ahead of schedule, but our parent company cleared anything not currently turning a profit off its books. Link was killed, and its staffers, who designed pages featured here, were laid off.
