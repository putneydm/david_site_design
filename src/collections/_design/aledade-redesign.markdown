client: Bose, Framingham, Mass.
project: Bose had an ambitious goal of creating and selling the first over-the counter hearing aid. It needed to be discreet, comfortable and stylish. It also needed to be dead-easy to use. I designed on-device controls -- boiling complex ideas down to a single button action -- so a user could quickly and easily access life-changing features.

## How might we ...

* Create a device that removes the stigma from hearing aid use
* Allow people to connect with others in social situations that are made difficult or impossible by hearing loss
* Guide a user through the setup process to eliminate the need for professional assistance 
* Launch a new FDA-regulated product category
