<!-- 
Varied presentations
I made a modular design that allowed me to pull out a component and swap in another quickly across all pages on the site or to build multiple versions of pages.



### Unique challenges
The site was built on a short schedule for a fall launch. We worked with an offshore developer for Wordpress integration and engineering. 

### Opportunities
The site was to be a news and lifestyle site in the vein of a secular news site — no crosses, no stained glass. We had a budget to work with, a rarity in the in the “can you get it for free somehow?” World of news design. The site’s audience goals also meant it was a unique brand that could be set apart from the parent company’s news verticals. 

### What went well
The site launched on time. 

### What I learned
Xxxx

### Interesting factoids
I was asked to not use the color  hex value `#666 `after someone spotted it in the source code.
The 404 screen featured the prayer of St. Anthony, the patron saint of lost items. -->

### Where is it now?
Crux was launched with no real business plan or market research. Many of its ambitious goals — the Vox Populi section — failed to resonate. “Catholics” in and of themselves are not a market segment, so targeted advertising was not successful. Eventually the site was sold to the Knights of Columbus, who redesigned the site. However, my logo is still in use.  -->
