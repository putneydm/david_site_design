### The Client

 MIB is a XXX-year-old Framingham, Mass-based company that serves the insurance industry. There service is a bit like a credit-reporting service for insurance companies.  They provide major insurance companies who are MIB members with information to guarantee the validity of applicant information and verify applicant data across all members. 

### What we built

An electronic medical record search and delivery portal. 

### My role

Design lead and front-end developer 
* Designed the user interface and flows
* Prototyping in Sketch
* Design system documentation and deliverable
* Front end-development (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Jira user stories and acceptance criteria writing
* Ideation and design planning sessions
* User testing and validation
* Particpant in the agile process — presenting work during the grooming process, sprint planning


### The ask
MIB wanted to enter the fast-growing field of delivering electronic medical records for life insurance applicants to their member companies. At present, doing a medical background check takes weeks or months, with multiple requests and replies going back and forth between insurers and a constellation of medical providers. It’s a complicated, expensive process that can result in a high abandonment rate as applicants become frustrated with the long back-and forth and multiple steps and requests. Essentially a Google for medical records — although that’s a bit of a simplification due to the technical hurdles. 

### The problem 

While medical records are a standard format, which provider holds the records are anything but certain. That means hitting multiple endpoints. Companies such as Epic and Veradigm have the largest marketshare. However, many are located in state-level record exchanges or even at health care orgs themselves. The Veterans Administration has a vast trove of records. 

Additionally, medical records delivered via traditional means are often PDF format or scanned documents. Companies are looking to automate processes and would prefer them in electronic form — as raw data — that can feed this process. 

Providers are industrial-grade enterprise software. Each has a different workflow,  applicant requirements, response times and document delivery methods. These would need be normalized into a single user-friendly experience. 


Integrating multiple medical record providers and their disperate workflows into a single, coherent normalized workflow. Users would be create a single record request to all providers and be presented with a simple, clear user interface to track status of requests. 

### My process

My job was to see the design through from its genesis all the way to final implementation. 

This would begin with a two- or three-part design session with stakeholders, developers and other interested parties. I would collate and report back findings. Then go into the design process, doing multiple iterations that would be presented to the the team and stakeholders for approval. 

Once approved, I would write the jira tickets — user stories, acceptance criteria, attach designs — and then see the tickets through the grooming process and into the sprints themselves. 

Then, I would participate in sprints as the front end developer. I was owner and maintainer of a large HTML and CSS codebase stored in the MUB Git repository.

I worked with the other members of the dev team to complete integration and implementation of features with Angular engineer and back-end team. 

Then I would see it through the QA process, bug fixes and other pre-launch processes.
