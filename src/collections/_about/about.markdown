I’m David Putney. I'm a UI/UX designer and front-end developer for a Boston-area technology consultant. I work remotely and live in the Silicon Slopes area of suburban Salt Lake City / Ogden, Utah. It's a lovely place, nestled in a valley and surrounded by mountains. 

### I like to make things

I like to make stuff. That has been a constant in my career. I'm a senior designer at a digital design and development agency in Boston. I do UX/UI and visual design, prototyping, UX testing, agile, -- all that and more -- for clients both large and small. I also love to build what I design -- this site you are currently reading, for instance. As such I am proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript -- and some React and React Native.

### I made this site

As mentioned, davidputney.com is my own development work, so I accept both blame and praise. Through the years I’ve built more than a few versions of Davidputney.com. This is probably the sixth or seventh since 1999. I call this the “circa 2020” version. To be honest, it's getting a little long on the tooth. The source code -- particularly the JS -- needs a refactor that I'm not really willing to do right now.

For the font geeks out there, the script font in the header is [Lavenderia][2], the sans-serif headline font is [Ginger][3] and the body copy is set in Droid serif.

### I spend a lot of my free time hiking 

Before all this, I worked as a print designer and editor for newspapers in Michigan, suburban Chicago, The U.S. Virgin Islands and Norfolk, Va. While in Norfolk, was co-founder of a popular, award-winning -- yet tragically doomed -- daily [newspaper.][4] After its demise, I moved to the web, first as a news producer and later I designed and built [several][5] websites for a large Boston-area media company.
