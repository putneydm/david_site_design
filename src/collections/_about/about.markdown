I’m David Putney. My day job is a UI/UX designer in the Boston-area. Before that, I spent about 20 years in newspapers in the U.S. and overseas.

I'm now a senior designer at a digital design and development agency here in Boston. I do UX/UI and visual design, UX testing, sprints, agile, -- all that stuff for clients both large and small. I love to build as well as design, and as such I am proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and some React. 

Before all this, I mainly worked as a print designer and editor. I was co-founder of a popular, award-winning, yet, tragically doomed daily newspaper. After that I designed and built websites for a large, Boston-area media company. 

This site is my own development work, so I take both blame and praise for it. Through the years I’ve built more than a few versions of the Davidputney.com. This is probably the sixth or seventh since 1999. I call this the “circa 2014” version. 

If you actually feel like rooting around in my source code, or even running your own guerrilla version of Davidputney.com, head over to [Github][1] and git clone to your heart’s content.

For the font geeks out there, the script front in the header is [Lavenderia][2], the serif headline font is [Ginger][3] and the body copy is set in Droid serif.

This site contains a blog. I write here about various topics of interest to me. Any views expressed here are my own and not of my employer, both current or former.
