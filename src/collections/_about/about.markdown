I’m David Putney. My day job is a UI/UX designer and front-end developer. Before that, I spent about 20 years working in newspapers in the U.S. and overseas. 

I currently live in the Silicon Slopes area of suburban Salt Lake City. It's a lovely place, as you can see from the header images on this page and others on this site. I spend a lot of time hiking in the surrounding Wasatch Mountains.

I'm a senior designer at a digital design and development agency in Boston. I do UX/UI and visual design, prototyping, UX testing,  agile, -- all that stuff and more -- for clients both large and small. I love to build the stuff that I design, and as such I am proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and some React and React Native.

Before all this, I mainly worked as a print designer and editor for newspapers in Michigan, suburban Chicago, The U.S. Virgin Islands, and Norfolk, Va. While in Norfolk, was co-founder of a popular, award-winning, yet tragically doomed, daily [newspaper.][4] After that I designed and built [several][5] [websites][6] for a large Boston-area media company. 

This site is my own development work, so I accept both blame or praise. Through the years I’ve built more than a few versions of  Davidputney.com and occasional updates. This is probably the sixth or seventh since 1999. I call this the “circa 2020” version. To be honest, it's getting a little long on the tooth, but the source code -- particularly the JS -- would take a refactor that I'm not really willing to do right now.

For the font geeks out there, the script font in the header is [Lavenderia][2], the sans-serif headline font is [Ginger][3] and the body copy is set in Droid serif.

This site contains a blog. I write here about various topics of interest to me. Any views expressed here are my own and not of my employer(s), both current or former.
