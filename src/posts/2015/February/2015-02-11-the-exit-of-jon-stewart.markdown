The exit of Jon Stewart from "The Daily Show" was something like Obi Wan Kenobi's announcement of a disturbance in the force and millions of voices crying out.

We will of course be treated to numerous encomiums to Stewart in the next few weeks and months. The press that Stewart so often skewers pretty much love him. That alone should suggest he's not doing it right.

The press maybe loves him a little *too* much, too much to think about his show in a critical fashion. That he could be the ["Walter Cronkite" of his generation][8] is pretty much a bad thing.

Stewart is a funny guy. I've liked his brand of comedy since his short-lived [MTV talk show][4] in the 90s. He struggled for a long time before finding success, and for that I admire him quite a lot. But I haven't been on board with "The Daily Show" for a long time.

The biggest problem with the "The Daily Show" is that it and Stewart never want to take responsibility for what it is: an ideological show.

You see it in stunts such as when Stewart's "stop hurting America" appearance on [CNN][5] where he decried the excesses of "Crossfire." You saw it in a "[Jon Stewart destroys][2]" viral video, now expanded to the "[John Oliver destroys][3] ..." brand.

Stewart was always quick to set aside claims of seriousness and [political messaging][6] by claiming he was just a comedian. Here to make people laugh, that's all.

But Stewart was never into just nihilistic snark. He actually did have point to make. As Roger Ebert famously said, the only true way to criticize a movie is make another movie.

Stewart loves to act that he's somehow above it all, but his critique of a news program *is* a news program. And it's not a good one, as judged by its ability to inform.

Stewart uses mockery as a rhetorical device, but mockery isn't the same as criticism. Mockery plays into an audience's prejudices and preconceptions. It is a show built for people who don't even want to engage with the other side.

Political viewpoints and ideas have to be tested and argued to gain strength and resonance. Debating ideas hones them to a sharp point. "The Daily Show" is a pillow fight.

"The Daily Show's" favored format is to treat people of different political viewpoints as not just worthy, principles opponents but as stumped-toothed morons, bigots and opportunists.

"Daily Show" fans like to think of themselves as sophisticates who have heard and examined both sides, a fact on display at Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity. Attendees carried [signs][1] claiming they were open to new ideas and could be persuaded.

But his is really just an audience that's rarely wandered out of its own ideological silo.

Stewart's show, on a certain level, was just pandering to a crowd. That hurts America.
