Why are we willing to accept some sorts of horrors and not others? In this regard, we seem completely irrational.

As a simple, albeit limited, thought experiment, consider cars. Setting aside the denuding the [landscape][1] to accommodate them and their general environmental damage, consider their more personal impact.

No invention has visited more sudden horror and grief upon the common citizen in the modern age. When car accident happens, it's sudden and horrendous. The injuries and deaths are of the kind typically seen in wartime.

More than [30,000 people][2] in this country - babies, children, adults, elderly -- meet violent, untimely ends in them each year. Tens of thousands more are injured or permanently maimed.

[2]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year

A childhood acquaintance was paralyzed in a car crash at 19, spent several years in a wheelchair and died from complications in his mid-20s. He's been gone now longer than he ever lived.

The horrors visited upon victims aren't even the result of malice. A tiny error on the part of another driver -- a missed red light for instance -- can end someone's life brutally,  suddenly and unfairly.

Yet, most folks seem unconcerned about these stats and facts. Cars hold an esteemed, central place in our lives. We [admire][3] them for their speed and their looks. On a more personal level, we spend large amounts of our money on them.

People who buy guns are pegged as "gun nuts," but we don't consider someone who buys a car to be crazy, just practical. We don't say that they are contributing to a national horror. It's all just normal.

To quote *The Dark Knight* people don't care as much about cars because it's all just part of the [plan][4].

**I've been thinking** about guns lately. How could one not, really.

The car analogy, though limited in its comparison to guns, still provides a useful reminder of our fundamental irrationality. We are willing to accept a certain amount of death and horror if the reasons are good enough.

It's not just cars either. People are [blown up][5], electrocuted, drowned, asphyxiated, poisoned and burned to death because of services that we allow into our homes. These are all terrible ways to die

The fact is undeniable that we have created a dangerous world. Not that it hasn't always been dangerous. We've fended off many of the horrors of the natural world -- animal attacks, germs, starvation -- and replaced them with a world where we are killed in great numbers by our own inventions.

If this is the reality of our world, why exactly are guns so different than anything else that kills us in a more benign fashion?

&nbsp;

**None of this** is to minimize the true horror of the recent Umpqua Community College [shooting][6] or any other. The idea that one could be sitting in a college class and have a gunman walk in the door is a viscerally terrifying as any imaginable.

[6]:http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/33601783-75/umpqua-community-college-students-arrive-back-on-campus-10-days-after-gunmans-rampage.html.csp

On a mental level we are less willing to accept this than, say a recent crash that killed a [busload][7] of college students. Yet, in both scenarios the victims are just as dead.

[7]:http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/seattle-bus-collides-duck-tour-killing-2-officials-say-n433156

But we shouldn't just accept senseless murder. Somehow it feels more wrong. But that outrage doesn't always translate well. Before anyone knew much of anything about the Oregon killings, people had already taken to Twitter to:

* Call for gun control
* Denounce those calling for gun control.
* Denounce those who are denouncing those calling for gun control.
* Etc.

It's the new [St. Vitus' dance][8] of post-tragedy America. It's not really a reaction, at least not in the strictest sense.

[8]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydenham%27s_chorea

People who were tweeting about gun control want it regardless. They want it whether it's a lovely Sunday afternoon at the beach or right after a horrendous crime.

The reverse is true of people who are [Second Amendment][9] absolutists. They want to buy guns, own and carry them, _period_. The event itself is irrelevant to shaping opinion on the matter.

[9]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution

No fact about the tragedy -- if the gun was legally or illegally obtained, whether the crime was politically motivated, whether the shooter was mentally ill -- could change their opinion.

It exists as a [Rorschach][10] inkblot onto which everyone projects their views.

[10]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test

That's why the political discussion directly after a crime of this type is so distasteful. It's about windows of opportunity to get one's point heard.

&nbsp;

**Perhaps if anyone** had anything new to say, any new solutions to offer, the discussion wouldn't be so crass.

What's so striking about the discussion is how sure both sides are that their *exact* proposal is the right fix that will definitely work. Any idiot can see it.

Here's the two arguments, in TL;DR form:

* No one should be able to buy or own a gun. They serve no positive purpose. Gun control would reduce the number of guns and therefore the number of deaths from them.
* Gun ownership is enshrined in the constitution because you have a right to defend yourself against others and government tyranny. Gun control disarms honest citizens and leaves them vulnerable. The duty falls to gun owners to be responsible.

Even the framing doesn't change all that much. The pro-gun control argument says something along the lines of "Well, we need to do something, ineffectual or not." The other side argues that "none of that will work, and it's not legal to boot, so why try?"

This [clip][11] from *Morning Joe* pretty much illustrates the shouting past each other aspects of the debate.

[11]:http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/10/02/charles_cooke_on_oregon_shooting_why_are_young_men_between_15-30_taking_out_anger_on_soft_targets.html

The debate also has shades of the [argument from ignorance][12] fallacy, the quite human notion that if some solution hasn't been disproved, it must be correct. Add in the notion that the more our ideas are threatened, the more we tend to defend them.

[12]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance

Both sides spend an inordinate amount of time trying to prove their others' argument is completely false.

But an honest read of either side finds truth in both views. Yes, people do use guns to defend themselves. Here's a [case][13] and [another][14] from last week.

[13]:http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/1-Shot-Dead-at-Waterbury-Cafe-331886291.html#

[14]:http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/customer-fatally-shoots-robber-charleston-waffle-house-article-1.2393200

And, yes, easy availability of guns does lead to gun crime. The number of legally and illegally obtained guns used this way makes this point inarguably true.

Yet, these two views are irreconcilable. One or the other has to win. There are no "commonsense gun" laws<sup>[1][15]</sup> that will make a difference. The effect of the [assualt weapons ban][16] of the '90s was negligible.

[15]:#footnote-gun-control-one

[16]:http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/16/16549416-was-the-last-assault-weapons-ban-effective?lite

And there is no libertarian gun utopia that will keep guns out of the hands of those who intend to do harm.

The gun debate is quite literally a toxic hellstew.

&nbsp;

**The problem is** that the underpinnings and basic assumptions of *both sides* are wrong. Well, maybe not wrong. Incomplete. Faulty. Riven with logical fallacies. Subject to oversimplification.

A favorite Twitter genre is the "in one chart" tweet, perhaps because of the belief that all things can be made simple. I've seen a lot "Here's why gun control works in one chart." A popular one is about gun control in Australia.

After the terrible Port Arthur [mass shooting][17] in 1996 that killed 35, that country instituted not only gun control, but outright gun confiscation. Firearm ownership plunged. The country has not had a large mass shooting since.

[17]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_(Australia)

Although, it didn't seem to prevent [this][18]. Or [this][19].

[18]:http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/19/at-least-seven-children-killed-in-mass-stabbing-in-cairns

[19]:http://www.9news.com.au/National/2015/10/02/17/01/Two-feared-shot-in-Parramatta-in-Sydney-s-west

If one directly led to another, that's unquestionably a good thing. Even the most ardent Second Amendment fan can't object to reduced death.

Or it could just be a [post hoc ergo propter hoc][20] fallacy. The whole thing is rather blurry.

[20]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc

For example Australia's [murder rate][21] did go down.

> Over the past 18 years (1 July 1989 to 30 June 2007), the rate of homicide incidents decreased from 1.9 in 1990-91 and 1992-93 to the second-lowest recorded rate, of 1.3, in 2006-07.

[21]:http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html

So, gun confiscation, yay! Or maybe not.

That drop pales next to the United States, which in the same time period *halved* not only its [homicide rate][22] but its serious crime rate, too. And this was during a time of liberalized gun ownership rules and record gun sales.

[22]: http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/ldah6rdp6ukvngoyqi1fcg.gif

So, yay gun ownership!

Diving even deeper, one can find correlations in a nation's gun ownership vs. murder rate<sup>[2][26]</sup>. But 1:1 is hard to find.

[26]:#footnote-gun-control-two

The United States has the highest gun ownership [rate][23] in the world, more than double the No. 2 country. Yet it ranks 111th in homicide [rate][24]. Honduras ranks 87th in gun ownership and is first in homicide rate.

[23]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country

[24]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate

The goal here isn't to litigate every single argument of the gun control debate as it is to emphasize that guns, crime and gun deaths are a far messier problem than any one side with a quick solution will admit to.

They certainly don't fit in the length of a single tweet.

Like the blind men and the elephant, it seems possible to make any argument out of gun ownership statistics.<sup>[3][25]</sup>

[24]:#footnote-gun-control-three

&nbsp;

**Perhaps violence** rates are really just a question of the nature of a nation's people, that nations without guns have low rates because nations with a less murderous spirit have less desire for guns.

My criminolgy professor in college described the difficulty of studying and predicting behaviors like homicide because of their rarity and non-repeatedness compared with other behaviors. A person can lead a respectable life right up until they kill someone.

In some ways we just don't know.

The problem of guns and murder in the United States looks simple, but it quickly fractalizes as you get closer and closer to the subject. The causes branch. They interconnect. The whole becomes less obvious. The solutions less clear. It's a tangled mess.

Buzzfeed News took an evenhanded look at the [difficulty][25] of the problem a couple weeks ago. Among the points was that gun control is more likely to reduce suicide rates than murder rates.

[25]:http://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/how-to-reduce-gun-violence

> If they can't get their hands on a gun, chances are that someone desperate enough to consider killing themselves will survive: The fatality rate for suicide attempts overall is around 9%; but where a firearm is used, that rises to 85%.

Add into the mix that the murder rate among blacks is eight times higher than whites, and the death rates also skew disproportionatly toward blacks too. This fact doesn't racially vilify so much as point out that addressing problems of poverty, education and social isolation among that segment would probably do more to reduce homicides than gun control.

&nbsp;

**Gun control is** a zero sum game, it seems. It's likely to remain so.

We are in a debate in which the only acceptable solution for either side is total destruction of the other's viewpoint. It's become about winning.

In many ways, the debate is actually already over, and the gun control side lost. It's a political loser in all but the most liberal states.

Consider what that actually means.

To return to my original comparison, yes cars will get people around fast. But they will also kill people.

We've come to accept that. We accept a lot. Maybe we've come to accept gun death too.

1. <span id="footnote-gun-control-one">"Common sense gun safety laws" is a carefully vetted talking point. Be suspicious of anyone who uses it.
2. <span id="footnote-gun-control-two">If tortured enough, stats will admit to anything. The cynically titled *How to Lie with Statistics* provides a helpful primer on how this is done.
3. <span id="footnote-gun-control-three">I'm choosing to focus on murder as a measure. "Gun violence" stats are suspect because they include suicides, accidents, self-defense and other metrics to inflate the numbers. Every country measures "gun violence" differently Murders rates, however, are apples to apples.
