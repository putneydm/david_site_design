I was 8-years-old and in the second grade in 1976, the Bicentennial Year for the United States. The small town I lived in had an essay contest with the subject "What America Means to Me."

My fiercely jingoistic writing<sup>[1][1]</sup> won second place, which was a silver dollar, and I got to read my essay in front of the town council. My mom saved it and gave it to me a few years ago.

Here's that essay:

>*America is a loving union on earth and beautiful. Im glad christopher columbus found it. With people helping each other and sharing and working together. Its a country of freedom its great because everybody it taking care of people helping them grow. the end David Putney*

Have a happy and fun July Fourth weekend.
