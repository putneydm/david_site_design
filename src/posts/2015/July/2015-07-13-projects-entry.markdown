I mean, officially I deplore violence, "but that was totally worth" the loss of karma points! Don't strain your brain trying, then. Might break something. One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality.

How did you find me here? "Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down." When I say, 'I love you,' it's not because I want you or because I can't have you. -- Welcome to the future, where cars fly, robots serve our every whim, and genetically engineered dinosaurs rule the Earth. Say, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug?

Looking in windows, knocking on doors. The living legend needs eggs! Why not default them with ninja skills or whatever?
It has nothing to do with me. Spike! It's Spike. And he's wearing a coat. Oh Spike, devour me! The gentlemen are coming by. They've got those hoppy legs and twitchy little noses. With any luck, he'll poke the wrong one and end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a fifty-foot Giles that squishes annoying teeny pirates.

You will keep a civil tongue in this house or we'll put your tongue in a stew. What, you think this isn't real just because of all the vampires, and demons, and ex-vengeance demons, and the sister that used to be a big ball of universe-destroying energy? One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality. Well, you were busy trying to get yourself lit on fire.

But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and frugal. It's about women. Can you just be kissing me now? I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move. How did you find me here? Oh my god you will never believe what happened at school today.

It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you? You always hurt the one you love. I am never gonna see a merman, ever. Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us?

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes. I was actually at Woodstock. That was a weird gig. I fed off a flower person, and then I spent the next six hours watching my hand move.

Better to cut you down to size, grandma. What do they need such good eyesight for anyway? Bunnies! Bunnies! It must be Bunnies! Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
