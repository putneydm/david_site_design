It is said that Thomas Jefferson was such an inveterate tinker that [Monticello][1] was in a simultaneous state of being built while falling down.

Likewise this site.

Davidputney.com been in a continual state of repair and renovation since launch. (I'm sure you all noticed the new data-URI/local storage [font loader.][2]) My latest change, is a bit more public.

I swapped out the sans serif font [Montserrat][3] with another sans, [Ginger][4]. It's a font I'd seen some time ago, but was reminded of it by one of my [former colleagues][8].

Ginger and Montserrat are both geometric fonts, but Monserrat has a bit of a modern edge. Ginger has an [Avant Garde-ish][5] mid-20th Century feel, as if it should be in a Don Draper advertising campaign.

Ginger has a smaller [x-height][6], -- generally I don't like fonts with small x-heights -- so I had to do some further tweaking to get the scaling right. And by "right" I mean I'll change it six more times this week.

Don't worry, though. I did some cache busting to make sure it loads properly. If you don't see the new font, I'll gladly refund your money.

But, setting aesthetics aside, the addition of Ginger puts Davidputney.com&reg; strongly "on brand" vis-a-vis my [hair color][7] and lack of ability to tan. And that's what we do these days anyway, is build our personal brand on FaceTweet.
