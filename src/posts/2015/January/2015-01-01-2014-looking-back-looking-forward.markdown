It's safe to say that 2014 was not a good year for me.

I got bogged down all summer and most of the fall in a hot mess of project at work. Friends were beset by problems. I spent most of the year depressed and deeply unhappy.

As far as I'm concerned, 2014 can just get the hell out of here and never come back. But, strangely, I wouldn't take *any* of 2014 back.

It pushed me in important new directions both personally and professionally. I'm entering 2015 with a feeling that suddenly, unexpectedly [everything is coming up Milhouse][1]. I'm enjoying that moment.

Life doesn't have a third act twist and a happy ending like movies and TV. Nothing I'm dealing with has been solved. But the random miseries of 2014 gave me enough clarity to tackle my bigger problems.

Friends came through for me in a big way. I'm still processing it all. I'm excited and scared.

A better 2015, maybe? Here's hoping.
