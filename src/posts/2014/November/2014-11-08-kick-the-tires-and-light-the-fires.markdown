We're live. Finally. It still has that new website smell.

I've been working on a new Davidputney.com pretty regularly since early October. It's not so much done as kicked out the door. Please be patient as I still clean up some of the messes that I made.

This replaces [an older](http://mosthorriblethingever.com/davidputney/) jQuery-based site that I built over a three-day weekend because I needed a portfolio site to apply for a job. This redesign is about the fourth guise for a domain that I've owned for 14 years now, probably to the dismay of [other David Putneys](https://www.google.com/search?q=david+putney&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=CTNeVNC4KMXOsQSqzYLQCw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1164&bih=641&dpr=2.2#imgdii=_) who have would like to have it.

Building this was also an interesting exploration for me. I have an upcoming post on some of the technology and philosophy that went into it.

Until then, welcome.
